For some time I was thinking of creating my own blog. The main goal was to record any cool stuff I would do during work or any issues I would overcome. Finally the time has come!

In this post I'll go through the steps I took to get a Gatsby starter blog up and running and deployed to GitHub pages.

## Why Gatsby

Gatsby blogs are usually static sites and the content for the posts use markdown. Easy to set up and run and a personal interest in React.

## Why GitHub pages

It's easy to deploy and it's free.

## Let's start

### 1 - Install the Gatsby CLI

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

### 2 - Choose a starter blog

Go to the Gatsby website and pick a starter.

**<https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2>**

In my case I used this one:

**<https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/ammarjabakji/gatsby-markdown-blog-starter/>**

### 3 - Create a GitHub repository

Create a repository named ``yourusername.github.io``.

### 4 - Create your starter blog into the repository

```bash
gatsby new gatsby-markdown-blog-starter https://github.com/ammarjabakji/gatsby-markdown-blog-starter
```

**A couple of notes here:**

- I created a separate branch to host the blog code where I do all dev and then run the deploy command.
- The deploy command pushes the files to the master branch.
- The master branch is the one that hosts the static files generated by the Gatsby build (Default GitHub pages configuration).

**Folder structure for a quick start:**

- content folder - where the blog posts are
- data/SiteConfig.js - site name, links, etc.

Deploy the website:

```bash
npm run build:gh
```

This command will clean the output folders, run a Gatsby production build and use the ``gh-pages`` npm package to deploy to GitHub.

**And that's it, navigate to your GitHub URL you should see the blog up and running!**
