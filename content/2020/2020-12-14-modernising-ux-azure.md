I recently co-hosted a webinar with Microsoft on the topic of Modernising Applications with Microsoft Azure tools.

You can watch it on-demand here:

Following on from my webinar, I’m releasing a blog series on Application Modernisation covering User Experience, Integration and Analytics.

As you can tell by the title of this blog post, I’ll be kicking off with User Experience and the Azure Tools that can be taken advantage of to modernise legacy applications to satisfy your users.

The post was published on Version1's Medium publication so check it out here:
